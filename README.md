The code provided appears to be a Python script that utilizes the OpenAI GPT-3 (and potentially GPT-4) model to perform various tasks related to code cleaning and modification. The functionality includes reading and processing files, interacting with the OpenAI API, and generating new code based on the input received.

Here's a brief breakdown of the code's main components:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - The script has dependencies on the `openai`, `tiktoken`, and `prettytable` Python modules. These need to be installed before running the code.

2. **Usage**:
   - The `CodeCleaner` class provides methods for reading and processing files, interacting with the OpenAI API, and system messages prompt handling.

3. **Code Examples**:
   - The main script instantiates a `CodeCleaner` object and demonstrates its usage by reading and processing a specific file.

4. **Design Decisions**:
   - The script uses the OpenAI API for generating code modifications and incorporates logic to handle different file types (e.g., .py, .md).

5. **Known Issues and Limitations**:
   - The script may have limitations or potential issues related to file handling and OpenAI API interaction.

6. **Future Improvements**:
   - Potential future improvements could include handling additional file types, refining the OpenAI interaction, and improving error handling.

7. **Contributing**:
   - The script doesn't explicitly mention contributing guidelines, bug reporting, or pull requests.

Given the nature of the code, it seems to focus on leveraging OpenAI's capabilities to automate code modification tasks. If you have specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
